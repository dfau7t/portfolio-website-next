                  This project examines how modern digital life, dominated by social media and the unique 
                  pressures of urban living, negatively impacts our mental health. It looks into how 
                  hyper-personalized algorithms trap us in "echo chambers" and how the constant stream of 
                  short-form content leads to 'brainrot'â€”a state of reduced critical thinking and emotional 
                  detachment. 
                  <br />
            
                  The research also explores how a city-based upbringing, with its digital-first communication 
                  and environmental stress, can make us more anxious and limit the real-world community ties often 
                  found in rural settings. Together, these forces create a constant state of overstimulation that 
                  disconnects us from ourselves.

                  "Echo Chamber" is my response: an immersive, interactive installation designed to challenge the 
                  passive way we consume content. The final concept is a geodesic dome that offers a break from this 
                  overstimulation. Inside, you influence a living piece of art and sound, with simple, abstract choices 
                  of a color and a shape. By projecting dynamic visuals that respond to your input, the installation 
                  becomes a contemplative space that mirrors your own internal state, free from the influence of an algorithm. 
                  <br />
            
                  It's a physical and mental escape from the "concrete jungle," created to foster a more mindful connection 
                  with our senses in a quiet, personal space away from our loud, hyper-personalized world.
